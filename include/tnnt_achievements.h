 * vanilla "reached Minetown" supplants Back to Civilisation
 * vanilla "entered a shop" might supplant "Dungeon Economics"
 * vanilla "consulted the Oracle" supplants "Sage Advice"
 * vanilla "read a Discworld novel" supplants "Escape to Discworld"
 * Some of the other vanilla achievements should be tracked as new vanilla
 * achievements, but possibly not all (depends on what we want to do with the

/*
TNNT TODO FOR 3.7: Here are some good achievement ideas we want to do but they
are best off waiting until 3.7 is released and TNNT rebases on it.

"Hit the Ceiling": Reach XL 30 and your role's highest rank. This will be a
vanilla achievement in 3.7.

Also, two achievements for hitting XL 10, and one somewhere around 20 (you get a
new rank at 10, but around 20 the options are 18 or 22 if we want to keep it
tied to ranks. Or just don't tie it to ranks and award it at 20.) This would
only be if we don't use the vanilla rank title achievements.

Dry out a wet towel with fire. That behavior only exists in 3.7.

Pacify your quest leader after angering them. Pre 3.7, if you anger them, you
just get kicked out and your game is unwinnable.

"Chain Reaction" - Blow up a monster by triggering another monster to blow up.
The only way to do this "organically" in pre 3.7 is to luck into two nearby gas
spores. Otherwise, it requires artificial methods such as reverse genocide or
create monster spam. 3.7 has more monsters that explode on death, so it's more
feasible to happen organically.

Kill a certain number of monsters with a single casting of chain lightning.
